Postman API Testing Portfolio

This repository contains API tests created using Postman. The collections are saved as .postman_collection.json files and include test scripts, variables, and different test scenarios.

Completed Collections

- Simple Grocery Store API

Includes both positive and negative test scenarios

Status code and error message checks

Uses collection variables and dynamic data

All test cases are saved as .md files inside the test-cases folder

Newman HTML report is included and all tests pass


- Trello API

Covers basic functionality like creating boards, lists, cards, moving cards and deleting boards

Uses authentication and collection variables

Test cases are not written yet

A Newman HTML report is included but shows failed tests, because the collection uses variables for authentication and no token was set

To run it successfully, set your own Trello API key and token as collection variables in Postman and click "Persist All" before exporting


Collections in Progress

- Valentine's Book List API

Some basic requests have been added

More tests and structure will be added soon


Extra Notes
Newman HTML reports are included for the completed collections, but may require proper authentication variables to pass all tests.
